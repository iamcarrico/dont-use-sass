## Compile times are long

Note: What more needs to be said here? A 'fast' project is 4s, but that can go up considerably. Why do we need a website to be under 1000ms but our preprocessor takes 5x longer than infinity. This causes all of our developers to cry out simultaneously in wails of pure pain.

Also, yesâ€” there is an XKCD for this. It is kind of awesome, but does not really apply to us. Because I think my boss won't understand that I have enough time to sword-fight with designers in 10s. https://xkcd.com/303/
