## The community makes it

Note: A piece of software is only as good as the people that make it, and we hae the best people. And you are the best people. Across the globe, from Hampton to Natalie to Chris E. to all the amazing conference organizers, the meetup organizers, the open source contributors, to the people who submit bugs on my issue queues, all of us have worked together to create an amazing, open, diverse community.
