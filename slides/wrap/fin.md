## Sass is not over

Note: Sass's power is still being developed, challenged, extended, and utilized. It's tools are being used to push forward the CSS spec in new and interesting ways. There may be one day that we see Sass stopped being used, but it is not anytime soon. I still use Sass, many major companies still use Sass, many tiny shops still use Sassâ€” and we can only help to make it even more awesome.
